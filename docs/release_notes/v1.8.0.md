# v1.8.0

## üöÄ Features

### Limited permissions support

The app now works with users that don't have full access to everything on the
server. The app will intelligently check permissions for each operation and
will tell you which operations are possible ans which are not.

### Custom Fields support

The app now supports **custom fields**!. You can add custom fields to documents
and edit their values. All custom fields types are supported, including
multi-select fields. You can also filter by custom fields and create saved
views that use custom fields, using a fully featured UI to create the filters.

### Other Features

- Remember setting for using the original filename as the title
- Add integration with server-side ASN prefix to data scanner
- Added a view for showing and exporting logs. This should hopefully circumvent
  issues with log file export
- Show note authors in notes view
- Add ability to filter by custom fields. This also includes creating / editing
  saved views that use custom fields.
- Enable Turkish language support
- Show owner in document list and detail view

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix issue with note users in API version 7
- Explicitly ignore caches for data fetches (keep for thumbnail requests)
- Fix new elements not being shown immediately in manage view
- Skip local network denied detection on iOS 26. This leads to a crash during login
