# Error "No access: XXX"

This error occurs when the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. This is usually the result of a faulty configuation in Paperless-ngx itself.

To resolve this issue, please navigate to the *Users & Groups* page in the *Administration* section, and make sure that the *View* checkbox is ticked for the user in question.
